# Notes

TODO:
 - proper createApp
 - connect extensions and plugins, provide method?
 - higher level API for creating standard extensions + higher order framework API for creating those?
 - extension config schema + validation
 - figure out how to resolve configured extension ref to runtime value, e.g. '@backstage/plugin-graphiql#GraphiqlPage'
 - make sure all shorthands work + tests
 - figure out package structure / how to ship, frontend-plugin-api/frontend-app-api
 - figure out routing, useRouteRef in the new system
 - Legacy plugins / interop
 - dynamic updates, runtime API
